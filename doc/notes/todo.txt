Instruction replay
------------------
Use the issue queue like the ROB: do not remove an instruction from it until the instruction is committed. If, for some reason, the instruction must be replayed (e.g., misprediction), it is enough to flush the pipeline and move the pointer to the index inside the issue queue corresponding to the wrong instruction.
